    <p><b>1. What are the benefits of using CSS?</b></p><br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p><br><hr><br>
    <p><b>2. What are the disadvantages of CSS?</b></p><br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
       - CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers. <br>
       - With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers. <br>
       - There exists a scarcity of security. <br>
       - After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers. <br>
       - The programming language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing. <br>
       - Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not). <br>
       - CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic. <br>
       - There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS. <br>
       - There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.</p><br><hr><br>
    <p><b>3. What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</b></p> <br> 
    <p>Ans. </p> <br><p>
     CSS2:- <br> <br>
     CSS splits up different sections of the code into modules. <br> There are new ways you can write CSS rules with a bunch of CSS selectors. <br>
     There is no backward compatibility with CSS2. <br> With CSS2 only web safe fonts can be used. <br>
     With CSS2 the concept of simple selectors were present. <br> Using CSS2, for rounded borders, coding the css styles were complex. <br>
     CSS 2, splitting text into multiple columns required complex coding because the standard was not equipped enough to break the text into columns so that it would fit into a box. <br>
     CSS 2 Doesn't support the Border- Box property  <br> <br>
     CSS3:- <br> <br>
     Both CSS and HTML were put into a single file, there was no concept of modules before. <br> There were no new ways of writing the CSS rules. <br>
     There is backward compatibility maintained with CSS 3 <br> With CSS3 special fonts can be used such as those in Google Fonts and TypeCast <br>
     With CSS3 the selectors were called as a sequence of simple seletors.com <br> With CSS3, there is provision for automatically assigning rounded borders to objects21 <br>
     CSS3 has the capability to split text into various columns so that each text block appears as a layout of the newspaper. <br>
     CSS3 supports the Border-Box property </p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>4. Name a few CSS style components</b></p><br>

    <p><b>6. How can the background color of an element be changed?</b></p><br>   
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        The background-color property of CSS is used to set the background of an element. We can set background color by selecting the element by its class name of id name and then apply the background-color property on it to set the background color.</p><br><hr><br>
    <p><b>7. How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</b></p><br> 
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.</p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>8. What is the use of the background-position property?</b></p><br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.</p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>9. Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</b></p> <br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        To set the scrolling of an image in the background, use the background-attachment property.</p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>10. Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</b></p> <br> 
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.</p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>11. How to center block elements using CSS1?</b></p><br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        we can simply make use of the <"center"> tag. All the elements within the <"center"> tag will be centrally aligned.</p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>12. How to maintain the CSS specifications?</b></p><br>

    <p><b>13. What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</b></p> <br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.</p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>14. What is embedded style sheets?</b></p><br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the <"style"><"/style"> tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document.</p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>15. What are the external style sheets?</b></p><br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>16. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</b> </p><br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
    Advantages:- <br><br>The use of external style sheets has advantages. There is no restriction to the number of web pages that can use the external style sheet. The look can be instantly applied to every single web page using an external style sheet. They can also assist in giving each page to which they have linked a consistent format. <br><br>
    Disadvantages:- <br><br>The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded. While implementing style sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check compatibility issues.</p> <br><hr><br>
    <p><b>17. What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</b></p><br>
    <p>Ans. </p><br><p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style.</p><br><hr><br>
